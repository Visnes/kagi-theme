# An OS X inspired pinstripe theme for Kagi!
Just copy the CSS from custom.css into your kagi user at [Settings â†’ Appearance](https://kagi.com/settings/appearance). Also, set your **"Show Results"** to **"Center"**, it will break set to left.

## Auto Light & Dark mode
This will change automatically based on your system settings. So if your system is set to light, it will show the light version.

# Buggy?
Will probably be because I'm useless at this.

Light mode looks like this
